    \begin{description}
        \item[Background] In the fission of actinides, the nearly back-to-back motion of the fission fragments has a strong effect on the kinematics of fission neutrons.
        This leads to a favoring of opening angles near 0$^{\circ}$ and 180$^{\circ}$ in the neutron-neutron (n-n) opening angle distribution of correlated neutron pairs from the same fission event.
        
        \item[Purpose] To measure the n-n opening angle and energy correlations in the photofission of $^{238}$U.
        As of this writing, measurements of correlated n-n opening angle distributions have been reported only for the spontaneous and neutron-induced fission of actinides.
        This work is the first to report such a measurement using photofission and will provide useful experimental input for photofission models used in codes such as MCNP and FREYA.

        \item[Method] Fission is induced using bremsstrahlung photons produced via a low duty factor, pulsed, linear electron accelerator.
        The bremsstrahlung photon beam impinges upon a $^{238}$U target that is surrounded by a large neutron scintillation detection system capable of measuring particle position and time of flight, from which n-n opening angle and energy are measured.
Neutron-neutron angular correlations are determined by taking the ratio between a correlated n-n distribution and an uncorrelated n-n distribution formed by the pairing of neutrons produced during different beam pulses.
        This analysis technique greatly diminishes effects due to detector efficiencies, acceptance, and experimental drifts.

        \item[Results] The angular correlation of neutrons from the photofission of $^{238}$U shows a high dependence on neutron energy as well as a dependence on the angle of the emitted neutrons with respect to the incoming photon beam.
        Angular correlations were also measured using neutrons from the spontaneous fission of $^{252}$Cf, showing good agreement with past measurements.
        \item[Conclusions] The measured angular correlations reflect the underlying back-to-back nature of the fission fragments.
        An anomalous decline in n-n yield was observed for opening angles near 180$^{\circ}$ for $^{238}$U. % the cause of which is unclear?
